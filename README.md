### 👋 I'm Ian Williams, also known as just iwilliams on the internet

I've been doing web dev for over 10 years and I also make indie games in my spare time. I have experience in a lot of different frameworks and tech, but my favorites are EmberJS and the Godot game engine. I'm currently looking for work, so if you want to give me one get in touch.
